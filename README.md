# Adverse-Food-Events
I utilized the Adverse Food Events dataset, which contains information about various adverse events related to food consumption. The dataset includes attributes such as the type of adverse event, food category, location, severity, and more.

To begin the analysis, I imported the necessary libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. Then, I loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and exploration.

Firstly, I used a pie chart to visualize the distribution of adverse events by their severity levels. This allowed me to quickly grasp the proportion of events categorized as mild, moderate, or severe.

Next, I employed a countplot from seaborn to depict the frequency of adverse events across different food categories. This helped in identifying which food categories were most frequently associated with adverse events.

To delve deeper into the dataset, I utilized a bar graph to showcase the distribution of adverse events over different locations or regions. This visualization provided insights into geographical patterns of food-related incidents.

Additionally, I utilized a histogram to analyze the distribution of reported adverse events over time. This helped in identifying any trends or patterns in the frequency of incidents over different time periods.

Throughout the analysis, I utilized numpy for data manipulation tasks such as filtering, grouping, and calculations to prepare the data for visualization. Matplotlib and seaborn were used for creating visually appealing and informative plots that facilitate easy interpretation of the dataset.

By leveraging these visualization techniques, I gained valuable insights into the adverse food events dataset, identifying patterns, trends, and key factors contributing to food-related incidents.
